# Welcome to my portfolio

My name is Laura and I am about to finish my very first semester at the UZH!


## My projects
### My projects, unrelated to my lectures
- [Grades]([https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/laura.christoph/grades_v1))
    - This project is what I call a "playground". 
    - Basically, I will never completely finish it, it's more intended to try out fancy things without any plan.
    - This project is supposed to display the grades.

### My projects, related to my lectures
- I still have to ask my friends whether they are okay with me publishing it or not.
