# Welcome to my portfolio

My name is Laura and I just finished my very first semester at the UZH!





## My projects
### My projects, unrelated to my lectures
- [Grades]([https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/laura.christoph/grades_v1))
    - This project is what I call a "playground". 
    - Basically, I will never completely finish it, it's more intended to try out fancy things without any plan.
    - This project is supposed to display the grades.

### My projects, related to my lectures
- I still have to ask my friends whether they are okay with me publishing it or not.

### Smaller projects
- Quick note: These are projects made during my studies with children. They are meant to be reproducible for children in the secondary school.
- This first project is a simple football game that I only recommend for children with experience in scratch.
    - [soccer single player](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/589842018)
- This project is a pingpong game. It can be splitted into partial projects in order to be reproduced.
